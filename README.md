The purpose of the site will be to help students decide what to do with their night.
There will be at least two categories: "Date Night" and "Party Night" under which users will input their suggestions. Some data to be collected from user inputs is A) where they went, B) whether it is 18+ or 21+ -- maybe even how easy the place is on fakes if it's 21+ -- C) a short description of the experience along with a rating, and D) the cost.  It provides insight into what students can do on a given night based on the experiences of others in the form of a Yelp-style discussion/review board.
